# CRUD Application

A simple web-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for product management. This project demonstrates basic web development concepts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new products with details like title, price, taxes, ads, discount, category, and count.
- **Read**: View all products in a structured table format.
- **Update**: Modify the details of an existing product.
- **Delete**: Remove a single product or delete all products.
- **Search**: Search products by title or category.
